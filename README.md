Simple sinatra app which access the TIMS XML feed available at https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs, and uses google maps to display current traffic disruptions in London. As the feed contains so many disruptions at one time, I have made them cluster together when zoomed out at a certain level. Clicking a cluster will zoom you in, and when zoomed in enough the individual markers, containing information, can be seen.
